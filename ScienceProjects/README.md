Exemplary programs that I wrote as part of my research projects.

1. phase_transitions.m (Matlab) was written to study the semicalssical and quantum properties of a central spin system close to a phase transition (PRA 86, 012116 (2012); open access at http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.3341). Large parts of the figures and calculations are based on variations of phase_transitions.m.

2. Surface_Acoustic_Waves.nb (Mathematica) is a toy program to study basic properties of so-called surface acoustic waves (SAWs), which are highly coherent and controlable mechanical waves localized on the surface of different materials. This program is part of a project which aims at using SAWs as a universal platform for quantum information processing (in preparation).

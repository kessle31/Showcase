Kaggle Competitions: Forest Cover Type Prediction
========

The competition: http://www.kaggle.com/c/forest-cover-type-prediction

This Neural Network learning algorithm predicts forest cover types from a given set of geographical features. Both test and training sets are available at kaggle.com. As an exercise, the Neural Network is implemented from scratch.
